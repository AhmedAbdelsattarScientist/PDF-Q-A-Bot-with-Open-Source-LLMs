# PDF-Q-A-Bot-with-Open-Source-LLMs
 This project is a PDF Question Answering system built in a Jupyter Notebook and designed to run easily on Google Colab with GPU support.​ The app loads a PDF from a URL, extracts its text, and lets the user ask natural language questions, which are answered by open‑source LLMs through Hugging Face transformers and a Gradio interface
